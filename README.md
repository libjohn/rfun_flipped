## workshop_rfun_flipped

This repo supports preparation for remote [zoom-based teaching. I'm flipping the workshop.](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/portfolio/r_flipped/)

## Preparation

R and the Tidyverse are a data-first coding language that enables reproducible workflows. In this two-part workshop, you'll learn the fundamentals of R, everything you need to know to quickly get started.

I recommend installing R and RStudio ([how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udPgQWHDpz8)) on your local machine. There are cloud versions of RStudio that will work. The cloud version has some very minor differences that, in my experience, are monumental differences for beginners. Therefore I recommend installing the R/RStudio locally if possible. Anyway, I think the flexibility of a local install outweighs the minor convenience of a cloud instance. I will not cover the differences in the workshop. Still another way is to use the cloud copy of this github repo by launching the binder.org button (above) -- You may need to be very patient while the launch configuration initiates (2-20 minutes. YMMV.)

### quickStart with R

The `quickstart.qmd` (or \_output/quickstart.html) represents the general outline of the flipped workshop -- i.e. what we can reasonably cover in [two 2-hour workshops (videos available.)](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/portfolio/r_flipped/) In fact, the `quickstart.qmd` file is the basic guide I follow when people sign-up for my workshops. Meanwhile the `outline.qmd` (or \_output/outline.qmd) file represents the grand overview of how to reach *Tidy data fluency with R* (book forthcoming). You can find an HTML report of the outline in the \_output directory. I serve these files out of github because I want you to immediately start using practical reproducible approaches and I want you to have the code locally. A book is great and I recommend many in the outline, but my goal is to get you working with code, today.

#### The workshop

This is a two-part workshop. In **Part 1** you'll learn the fundamentals of R, everything you need to know to quickly get started. You'll learn how to wrangle data for analysis, gain a brief introduction to visualization, practice Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and how to generate reports. In **Part 2** you'll learn about visualization using ggplot2, how to make interactive charts for use in dashboards, how to reshape and merge data, and be introduced to models.

##### Part 1 
No prerequisites and no prior experience is necessary. By the end of part 1 you will import data, edit and save scripts, subset data, use projects to organize your work, and develop self-help techniques.

- quickstart.qmd

##### Part 2

- ggplot_quick.qmd
- longer_wider.qmd
- regression.qmd

## Notes

There are URLs in the _outline_ and _quickstart_ files (and elsewhere).  Among those links you can find links to various static and interactive exercises.  And, I have a useful set of exercises at the [intro2r-code github repo](https://github.com/libjohn/intro2r-code).
