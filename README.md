Due to COVID-19, This repo supports preparation for remote [zoom-based
teaching. I’m flipping the
workshop.](https://rfun.library.duke.edu/portfolio/r_flipped/)

### quickStart with R

R and the Tidyverse are a data-first coding language that enables
reproducible workflows. In this two-part workshop, you’ll learn the
fundamentals of R, everything you need to know to quickly get started.

This is a two-part workshop. In **Part 1** you’ll learn the fundamentals
of R, everything you need to know to quickly get started. You’ll learn
how to access and install RStudio, how to wrangle data for analysis,
gain a brief introduction to visualization, practice Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA), and how to generate reports. In **Part 2** you’ll learn
about visualization using ggplot2, how to make interactive charts for
use in dashboards, how to reshape and merge data, and be introduced to
models.

**Part 1 has no prerequisites** and no prior experience is necessary. By
the end of part 1 you will import data, edit and save scripts, subset
data, use projects to organize your work, and develop self-help
techniques.
