## Duke University: Land Acknowledgement

[I would like to take a moment to honor the land in Durham, NC. Duke University sits on the ancestral lands of the Shakori, Eno and Catawba people. This institution of higher education is built on land stolen from those peoples. These tribes were here before the colonizers arrived. Additionally this land has borne witness to over 400 years of the enslavement, torture, and systematic mistreatment of African people and their descendants. Recognizing this history is an honest attempt to breakout beyond persistent patterns of colonization and to rewrite the erasure of Indigenous and Black peoples. There is value in acknowledging the history of our occupied spaces and places. I hope we can glimpse an understanding of these histories by recognizing the origins of collective journeys.]{.mediumtext}

## How to learn R efficiently

-   [Part 1: Data wrangling with {dplyr}]{.muted}

-   Part 2: (today) visualization with {ggplot2}, briefly: EDA, interactive plots, linear regression models

-   [Part 3: iterations & custom functions]{.muted}

-   [Part 4: case study in wrangling and visualization by ingesting multiple excel worksheets from multiple excel workbooks]{.muted}

## Today's Topics

-   {ggplot2} for visualization
-   {skimr} for EDA
-   {plotly} interactive graphics ({shiny} {observable})
-   Regression `lm()` and {broom}
-   Modeling and ML with {tidymodels}

## `{ggplot2}`

-   gg = grammar of graphics

-   From a 1999 book by Leland Wilkinson[^1]

-   Applied in an R package by Hadley Wickham.

-   {ggplot2} is one of the earliest packages and a core package of what has come to be known as the {tidyverse}
