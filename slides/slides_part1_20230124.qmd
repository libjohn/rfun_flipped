```{r}

countdown(minutes = 15, seconds = 00)
```

## Topics

-   How to use R
-   How reproducibility is easily accomplished
-   How to learn R efficiently
    -   Part 1 (today): focus on data wrangling with dplyr
    -   [Part 2: visualization with ggplot2, briefly: EDA, interactive plots, linear regression models]{.muted}
    -   [Part 3: iterations & custom functions]{.muted}
    -   [Part 4: case study in wrangling and visualization by ingesting multiple excel worksheets from multiple excel workbooks]{.muted}

## R, the Tidyverse, and Quarto

R is a programming language

1.  A data-first programing language → computational thinking
2.  The Tidyverse (and Tidymodels) is designed for humans
3.  Quarto Notebooks: a publishing system
    a.  Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations (slide-decks), websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
    b.  Works with other languages and IDEs

## Reproducibility

[**Reproducibility** - Obtaining computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis.]{.smalltext} [[^1]]{.smalltext}\
[**Replicability** - Obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.]{.smalltext}

[^1]: [National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM)]{.smalltext}

Goals of a tool-based, first-class approach

-   Do as much as possible with code

-   Integrate prose with code[; visualize inline]{.muted}

-   Generate reports for target audience

-   Iterate efficiently[; {purrr}]{.muted}

## Tidy data

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Each variable is a column

-   Each observation is a row

-   Each type of observational unit is a table
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Tidyverse

-   A dialect of R

-   Easier to learn because of consistency and documentation

-   Assumptions

    -   Data have semantic meaning that can be documented grammatically

    -   Tidy data are wrangled, visualized, and iterated easily via grammar

    -   50-80% of any data project is data wrangling\
        [{dplyr} & {tidyr}]{.muted}

## Pipe [\| data pipe \| data sentence]{.muted}

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1], [1], [-1], [1]]"}
A conjunction ("and then"), read left to right, creating a "data sentence"

`%>%` [({magrittr}\|{tidyverse})]{.muted} or `|>` [(base R)]{.muted}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
Starwars |>
    select(name, skin_color, homeworld)
```
:::

## Assignment

::: {layout="[[-1], [1], [-1], [1], [-1], [1]]"}
An object name "gets value from" a data pipe

`<-`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
small_df <- starwars |>
     filter(gender == "feminine")

```
:::

## Project

-   Keep stuff organized in the same directory\
    [e.g. data, analysis, scripts, documentation, and outputs]{.muted}

-   In the notebook, refer to subdirectories via relative paths\
    [better than `setwd()`]{.muted}

-   Shareability, portability, legibility, and **reproducibility**\
    [Use Restart-R-and-Run instead of `rm(list=ls())`]{.muted}

## Notebooks

[Literate coding]{.muted}

-   Intersperse prose and code

-   Integrated outputs with analysis

-   Render reports from code

## {`dplyr`}

::: {layout="[[1], [-1], [1], [-1]]"}
[`library(dplyr)` or `library(tidyverse)`. Use {dplyr} to wrangle data]{.mediumtext}

::: columns
::: {.column width="25%"}
`select`

`filter`

`arrange`

`mutate`

`group_by`

`summarize`
:::

::: {.column width="75%"}
subset by column

subset by row

sort

generate new variables

\

column totals [(or subtotals with `group_by`)]{.muted}
:::

## Upcoming workshops

-   Visualization with ggplot2 (and interactive graphics) & Modeling (syntax)

-   Iteration and custom functions

-   Quarto and Observable interactivity

## Rfun resources

-   Web scraping
-   Slide decks
-   Text mining, sentiment analysis, etc.
-   Dashboards ; interactivity
-   DBI: i.e. SQL without knowing SQL (working with databases)
-   git/GitHub

## Next steps

Best way to learn [and/or]{.muted} **consultations**

-   Take a small subset of a project you know well <br/> then recreate it in R
-   If you get stuck, schedule me for a free consultation <br/> walk-ins welcome
-   Documentation: {package-name}.tidyverse.org [(https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)]{.smalltext .muted}
-   Ask questions at RStudio Community ; R for DS online learning community ; R Ladies RTP
-   Formulate questions as **REP**roducible **EX**amples [(REPREX.tidyverse.org)]{.smalltext .muted}
